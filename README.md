# c_link_innonation_hackathon_submission

作为 INNONATION 区块链黑客马拉松的一部分,该项目由`C-Link团队`完成。

项目名称为`C-link`，我们项目主要目标是构建一个可实现隐私通信、合约签署、转移及执行于一体的区块链系统，将链下人才签约的法律效力外延到区块链上，实现链上人才的资产化，实现`以人才为本`这一愿景。
系统主要由隐私通讯、身份管理、合同管理及模板管理四大块组成。技术上主要结合了Substrate3.0、DHarithmetic、Signal protocol、IPFS、Zero-knowledge proof，ERC721等技术来实现。
使用C-link，可以实现人才合同自动生成、合同签署、合同转移、合同内容零知识证明及部分合同条款的自动执行。

As part of the INNONATION blockchain hackathon, the project was completed by the `C-Link team`.

The project name is `C-link`. The main goal of our project is to build a blockchain system that can realize private communication, contract signing, transfer and execution, and extend the legal effect of off-chain talent signing to the blockchain. Realize the capitalization of talents on the chain and realize the vision of `Talents-oriented`.
The system is mainly composed of four parts: privacy communication, identity management, contract management and template management. Technically, it mainly combines Substrate3.0, DHarithmetic, Signal protocol, IPFS, Zero-knowledge proof, ERC721 and other technologies to achieve.
Using C-link, you can realize the automatic generation of talent contracts, contract signing, contract transfer, zero-knowledge proof of contract content, and automatic execution of some contract clauses.
